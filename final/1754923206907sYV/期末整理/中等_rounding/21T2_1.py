# Q4 递归 stack栈 难度简单

from itertools import product


# Takes as argument a string consisting of 0s, 1s and underscores.
# If underscores are replaced in all possible ways by 0s and 1s,
# then one gets the representation of numbers in base 2.
#
# Prints out two lists of numbers:
# - one where the numbers are represented in base 2
#   without any leading 0 (except for the number 0 itself);
# - one where the numbers are represented in base 10.
# In both lists, numbers are ordered from smallest to largest.
#
# You can assume that the function is provided with a string as argument.
