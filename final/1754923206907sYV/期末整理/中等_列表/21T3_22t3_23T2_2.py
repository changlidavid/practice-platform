# The list "gaps" to compute is a list of 2 lists:
# - the list of all INCREASING gaps between 2 successive members of L,
#   with no duplicate, sorted in INCREASING gap length
#   and for a given gap length, sorted in INCREASING first gap member;
# - the list of all DECREASING gaps between 2 successive members of L,
#   with no duplicate, sorted in DECREASING gap length
#   and for a given gap length, sorted in DECREASING first gap member.
# You can assume that L is a list of integers.
