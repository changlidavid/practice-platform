# Q1 统计计数 难度一般

from random import seed, shuffle


# Generates a list L consisting of all integers
# between 0 and nb_of_elements - 1, in some random order.
#
# Consider the following lists with at least 2 elements:
# - the members of L from L's smallest element
#   to L's largest element,
#   read from left to right if the former occurs before the latter in L,
#   read from right to left if the former occurs after the latter in L;
# - the members of L from L's second smallest element
#   to L's second largest element,
#   read from left to right if the former occurs before the latter in L,
#   read from right to left if the former occurs after the latter in L;
# - the members of L from L's third smallest element
#   to L's third largest element,
#   read from left to right if the former occurs before the latter in L,
#   read from right to left if the former occurs after the latter in L.
#
# Outputs those lists preceded with some text, that explains the order
# in which they are output.
#
# Note that <BLANKLINE> is doctest's way to express that your code
# should produce a blank line; do not let your code print out <BLANKLINE>...
#
# You can assume that the function is called with integers as arguments.
