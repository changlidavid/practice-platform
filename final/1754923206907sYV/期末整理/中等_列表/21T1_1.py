# ONLY THE FIRST (LEFTMOST) occurrence of n in L that is the sum of two
# numbers that occur before in L is recorded in R.

# When an occurrence of a number n is recorded in R, we also record
# the unique pair (a, b) such that:
# - n = a + b,
# - a and b occur before in L, and
# - a occurs AS MUCH TO THE LEFT in L as possible.
